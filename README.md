# Overview

This repo focuses on the effect that distributed model training has on training time. We will experiment with different number of nodes (up to 3) as well as with different types of neural network models (e.g. simple dense nn, ResNet 50, Bert).

# TODO

*   Update imdb_sentiment_analysis
*   Upload enviroment.yaml (Theo)
*   Add multinode setup script
*   Improve model examples
*   Run multinode training with 2 and 3 different nodes
*   Create report
*   Upload results on README and polish repo
